# sorting_visualizer
A sorting visualizer is a application to help users understand and visualize the process of sorting data in a systematic and intuitive way. Sorting is a fundamental concept in computer science and plays a crucial role in various applications, from organizing lists of names to optimizing data for efficient retrieval in databases. The primary purpose of a sorting visualizer is to make the sorting algorithms more accessible and comprehensible to users by providing a visual representation of the sorting process.

key features and components typically found in a sorting visualizer:

1)The visualizer has a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the sorting process. It may include options to generate new array, select a sorting algorithm ,adjust the size of array and control the speed of the visualization.

2)Area of the visualizer displays the data to be sorted in a graphical or tabular format. This area is where users can observe the changes in data arrangement as the sorting algorithm progresses.

3) Sorting visualizers offer a selection of sorting algorithms to choose from. Common sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap sort. Users can select an algorithm to visualize its operation.
4)color coding to highlight the elements being compared or swapped during the sorting process. This helps users track the progress and identify the key actions of the algorithm.
5)Users can adjust the speed of the visualization to control how fast or slow the sorting algorithm executes. This allows users to observe the process at their preferred pace.

Sorting visualizers are frequently used as educational tools in computer science courses to help students grasp sorting algorithms and their complexities.
